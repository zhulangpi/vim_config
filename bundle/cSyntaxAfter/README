This plugin was initially created for codeblock_dark color theme (vimscript #3266) to highlight operators (+ - / * = <> () and others) in C-like languages. Why it's needed? Well, by default vim doesn't do that. After switching from Code::Block to vim I got really missed it.

Then the plugin grew into something bigger. I started to use it to unify overal syntax highlighting for C-like languages.

There are two ways to enable the plugin:

  1. If you want to use CSyntaxAfter highlighting as is, put this into your
  .vimrc:

     autocmd! FileType c,cpp,java,php call CSyntaxAfter()

  2. If you also want to extend the highlighting or add other C-like languages
  support (Java, Go etc), create a corresponding <filetype>.vim file in
  .vim/after/syntax/ and call CSyntaxAfter() from there instead.

  WARNING: For same file type use either option (1.) or (2.), basically avoid calling
  CSyntaxAfter() more than once.

  For example, to distinguish "++" and "--" operator from "+" and "-" in C and C++,
  remove "c" and "cpp" from autocmd above and instead create .vim/after/syntax/c.vim
  with (cpp syntax is based on c):

     if exists("*CSyntaxAfter")
        call CSyntaxAfter()
     endif

     syntax match longOperators "++\|--"
     hi longOperators guifg=green guibg=red
